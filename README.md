## 📚 What’s This About?
Welcome to my project repo! Here, I’ve turned a complex research paper on Explainable AI (xAI) into a fun and engaging children’s book. This project was part of an assignment for my Explainable AI class, where I tried to simplify a tricky AI concept like adversarial attacks through storytelling.

## 🌟 Background
This story is inspired by the paper “When Explainability Turns into a Threat: Using xAI to Fool a Fake News Detection Method”. 

The research dives into how xAI tools, which are supposed to make AI decisions clear, can be manipulated to trick AI systems into making mistakes.

Here’s what the story talks about:
Explainable AI (xAI): AI systems that aim to make their decisions understandable to people.
Adversarial Attacks: Malicious tricks that change AI inputs to confuse the system and make it give wrong predictions.

## 📖 What’s the Story?
In this book, Luna the wise owl and Max the clever fox are the heroes of Technoville, a lively town with helpful bots. When the bots start giving silly answers, Luna and Max set out to find out why. They discover that someone has been playing tricks on the bots, just like how adversarial users trick AI systems.

## ❓ Why did I do this?

Simplify Complex Ideas: I wanted to make tough AI topics like xAI and adversarial attacks easy to understand for kids.
Engage and Educate: By telling a fun story, I would LOVE to introduce children to important AI concepts in a way that makes sense to them.

## 🛠️ How I Made It
Illustrations: I used an AI tool (Childbook.AI) to create the book’s illustrations, making sure they were both fun and informative.
Storytelling: I adapted the story to reflect the research paper’s ideas, breaking down complex concepts into a playful adventure!
